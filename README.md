## About Me

I’m an **AI Workflow Developer** building reproducible, AI-assisted research systems with **human-in-the-loop orchestration**.  
I develop the **AI Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** method and the **Continuous Research Integration (CRI)** toolchain, which together turn AI-assisted work into **auditable, falsifiable, and shareable research artifacts**.  

My projects span both **scientific domains** (cosmology modeling, societal simulations) and **applied domains** (business text analytics), with a consistent focus on **reproducibility and transparency**.

---

## Core Focus

- **AI-assisted workflows** — pipelines that make AI outputs reproducible.  
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight** — validation, falsifiability, and decision logs.  
- **Transparency** — public repos with logs, artifacts, and citations.  
- **Applied analysis** — business use cases like review analytics.  
- **Scientific testbeds** — cosmology and societal models stress-testing reproducibility.

## Reproducibility Statement

My work is guided by one principle:  
**If it can’t be reproduced, it doesn’t count.**  

All flagship projects include pinned environments, logs, and artifacts for independent verification.
