## About Me  

I am an **AI-assisted researcher** focused on developing structured workflows for complex problem solving. My work centers on the **AI Orchestration Method (AOM)** — a framework for coordinating AI-human collaboration in research and applied analysis.  

My projects range from **theoretical physics** (cosmological modeling with *Waveframe*) to **practical applications** such as **customer review analysis**. Across all domains, I emphasize transparent documentation, reproducibility, and rigor.

## Core Focus  

- **AI-assisted workflows**: Designing, testing, and refining orchestration frameworks for reproducible research and applied projects.  
- **Research transparency**: Every project includes clear theory, methods, and citations.  
- **Applied analysis**: Building AI workflows for real-world data problems (e.g., customer review classification).  
- **Scientific modeling**: Developing and testing alternative cosmological frameworks.
