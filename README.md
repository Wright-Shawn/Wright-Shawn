## About Me  

I am an **AI Workflow Developer** focused on building reproducible, AI-assisted research pipelines with **human-in-the-loop orchestration**.  
My flagship project is the **AI Orchestration Method (AOM)** — a framework for coordinating multi-model AI collaboration, validation, and transparent documentation.  

I use AOM to test workflows across both **scientific case studies** (e.g., cosmology modeling) and **applied business problems** (e.g., customer review analysis).  
In every project, I emphasize reproducibility, transparency, and rigor.

## Core Focus  

- **AI-assisted workflows** → Designing, testing, and refining orchestration pipelines for reproducible AI research and applications.  
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight** → Embedding validation, falsifiability checks, and clear decision logs.  
- **Research transparency** → Providing workflow logs, documentation templates, and reproducible case studies.  
- **Applied analysis** → Deploying AOM on real-world business data problems (e.g., text classification, review analytics).  
- **Case study modeling** → Using scientific domains as testbeds for demonstrating workflow reproducibility (e.g., cosmology).

## Selected Work  

- [AI Workflow Orchestration](https://github.com/yourrepo/ai-workflow-orchestration) – Flagship repository formalizing the AI Orchestration Method (AOM). Includes workflow logs, documentation templates, and case studies.  
- [Waveframe Case Study](https://github.com/yourrepo/waveframe-v4) – Demonstrates AOM applied to cosmological modeling. Focused on falsifiability, workflow design, and reproducible analysis (not a physics claim).  
- **Applied Analysis** – Customer review classification pipelines showcasing how AOM can be adapted to business-relevant datasets.
