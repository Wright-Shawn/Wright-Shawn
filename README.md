## About Me

I am an **AI Workflow Developer** focused on building reproducible, AI-assisted research systems with **human-in-the-loop orchestration**.  
I created the **AI Orchestration Workflow (AOW)** — a methodological invention that transforms “using AI” into a **repeatable, auditable workflow** with versioning, logs, and reproducibility guarantees.

I use AOW across both **scientific case studies** (e.g., cosmology modeling) and **applied projects** (e.g., customer review analytics).  
Every project is designed to be reproducible, transparent, and creditable.

## Core Focus

- **AI-assisted workflows** → Engineering pipelines that make AI outputs reproducible.  
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight** → Validation, falsifiability checks, and decision logs.  
- **Transparency** → Public repos with documentation, reproducibility notes, and citations.  
- **Applied analysis** → Business use cases like review analytics and text classification.  
- **Scientific testbeds** → Stress-testing reproducibility in high-stakes domains (cosmology).

## Selected Work

- [AI Orchestration Workflow (AOW)](https://github.com/Wright-Shawn/AI-Workflow-Orchestration) – Flagship repository formalizing AOW. Includes workflow logs, documentation templates, and reproducibility practices.  
- [Waveframe v4.0](https://github.com/Wright-Shawn/Waveframe-v4.0) – A case study in cosmology using AOW to explore falsifiability and reproducibility in theoretical research.  
- **Applied Analysis** – Pipelines for customer review classification and text analysis, showing AOW applied to business contexts. *(Link coming soon.)*

## Reproducibility Statement

My work is guided by one principle: **if it can’t be reproduced, it doesn’t count.**  
All flagship projects include reproducibility files (environment pins, logs, and artifacts) so that results can be independently verified.
