## About Me  

I am an **AI-assisted researcher** focused on developing structured workflows for complex problem solving. My approach is built around the **AI Orchestration Method (AOM)** — a framework for coordinating AI-human collaboration in research and applied analysis.  

My projects range from **theoretical physics** (cosmological modeling with *Waveframe*) to **practical applications** such as **customer review analysis**. In every case, I emphasize transparent documentation, reproducibility, and rigor.

## Core Focus  

- **AI-assisted workflows**: Designing, testing, and refining AOM for reproducible research and applied projects.  
- **Research transparency**: All projects include theory, methods, and citations.  
- **Applied analysis**: Using AI workflows for real-world data problems (e.g., customer review classification).  
- **Scientific modeling**: Developing and testing alternative cosmological frameworks.

## Selected Work  

- [Waveframe Project](https://github.com/) – Cosmological modeling with entropy-driven expansion.  
- [Epistemology of Method](https://github.com/) – Formalizing AI-assisted workflows (AOM).  
- Applied examples – Customer review analysis and classification pipelines.
